# Parking-App
Summer Project, Machine Learning

- Pakring Lot Dataset
- Map Api, Google Maps ; parkWhiz
- Possible to identify parking spaces, need to find better pools of live data.
- Once ML model trained and made, measure performance and accuracy on map API
- Limited range to scan, maybe initial scan on populated areas and cache. Make efficient as possible, as user-friendly as possible
